# Zero Trust AWS Infrastructure

This Terraform configuration implements a Zero Trust security architecture in AWS, following security best practices and implementing defense-in-depth strategies. 🛡️

## Architecture Overview

### Network Security 🌐
- **Private VPC**
  - No public subnets or Internet Gateway
  - All resources in private subnets
  - VPC endpoints for AWS services
  - End-to-end encryption via TLS

### Security Services 🔒
- **AWS WAF**
  - Web Application Firewall with AWS managed rules
  - Protection against common web exploits
  - Custom rule sets for application-specific protection

- **GuardDuty**
  - Continuous threat detection
  - S3 and Kubernetes monitoring
  - Malware protection for EC2 instances

- **Security Hub**
  - CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
  - Centralized security findings
  - Automated security checks

- **VPC Flow Logs**
  - Network traffic monitoring
  - Stored in CloudWatch Logs
  - Traffic pattern analysis

### Identity & Access Management 👤
- **AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO)**
  - Centralized access management
  - Integration with enterprise identity providers
  - Role-based access control

- **Permission Boundaries**
  - Strict access controls
  - Region-restricted permissions
  - Prevention of privilege escalation

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with administrative access
- Terraform >= 1.0.0
- AWS CLI configured
- AWS Organizations with SSO enabled

```

## Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

2. Review the plan:
```bash
terraform plan
```

3. Apply the configuration:
```bash
terraform apply
```

## Security Features

### Zero Trust Implementation
- ✅ No public IP addresses
- ✅ All AWS service access via VPC endpoints
- ✅ End-to-end encryption
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Identity Federation
- ✅ AWS SSO integration
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Permission boundaries
- ✅ Least privilege access

### Security Monitoring
- ✅ GuardDuty threat detection
- ✅ WAF protection
- ✅ Security Hub integration
- ✅ VPC Flow Logs

## Best Practices

1. **Access Control**
   - Use SSO for user access
   - Implement least privilege
   - Regular access reviews

2. **Monitoring**
   - Review GuardDuty findings
   - Monitor Security Hub alerts
   - Analyze VPC Flow Logs

3. **Compliance**
   - CIS Benchmark compliance
   - Regular security assessments
   - Audit logging enabled

## Security Considerations

- Monitor GuardDuty for threats
- Review Security Hub findings
- Maintain least privilege access
- Regular security updates
- Monitor VPC Flow Logs

## Maintenance

Regular tasks:
1. Review security findings
2. Update IAM policies
3. Patch systems
4. Review access logs
5. Update security rules

## Variables

Key variables that can be customized:
- `aws_region`: AWS region (default: ap-south-1)
- `environment`: Environment name
- `vpc_cidr`: VPC CIDR block
- `private_subnets`: Private subnet CIDR blocks

## Outputs

Important outputs:
- VPC ID and subnet IDs
- WAF Web ACL ARN
- GuardDuty detector ID
- IAM role ARNs

## Contributing

1. Follow Terraform best practices
2. Maintain security controls
3. Document changes
4. Test thoroughly
